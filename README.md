Smart Water Monitoring System - Prediction Model

Overview

This project predicts daily water consumption for individual households using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical usage patterns, household characteristics, weather conditions, and conservation behaviors.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of:

train.csv: Training dataset (14000 x 12)

test.csv: Test dataset (6000 x 11)

sample_submission.csv: Sample submission format

Features Used

Timestamp: Converted to time-based features (Hour, Day of Week, Month)

Residents: Number of household members

Apartment_Type: Encoded categorical feature

Temperature, Humidity: Environmental factors

Water_Price: Water pricing at the time

Period_Consumption_Index: Relative water usage in an 8-hour period

Income_Level: Household income level (encoded)

Guests: Number of visitors

Amenities: Encoded categorical feature

Appliance_Usage: Whether water appliances are being used

Model Training Process

Data Preprocessing:

Converted Timestamp to datetime and extracted Hour, DayOfWeek, and Month.

Encoded categorical features (Apartment_Type, Income_Level, Amenities) using Label Encoding.

Checked and handled missing values if necessary.

Model Selection & Training:

Used XGBoost Regressor for training due to its efficiency with tabular data.

Performed train-validation split (80-20).

Applied early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Prediction & Submission:

Predictions were generated on test.csv.

Formatted output as water_consumption_predictions.csv with Timestamp as the index.

Dependencies

To run the script, install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost

Running the Script

Ensure train.csv and test.csv are in the same directory as the script, then run:

python train_model.py

The generated predictions file (water_consumption_predictions.csv) will be ready for submission.

Submission Format

The final CSV file must follow:

Columns: Timestamp, Water_Consumption

Index: Timestamp

Dimensions: (6000 x 2)

Files Included

train_model.py (Machine Learning script)

README.md (This file - explaining the approach)

water_consumption_predictions.csv (Final output file)

Notes:

XGBoost was chosen for its strong performance on structured data.

Feature engineering focused on time-based and categorical encodings.

Further improvements could include hyperparameter tuning and feature selection optimization.

ðŸš€ Happy Coding!
